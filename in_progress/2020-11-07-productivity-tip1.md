There are lots of tips and tricks that can make our life and work easier. Personally I really love them because thanks to simple things
I can save lots of time and effort every day. Therefore, I am going to share few things that work for me. Obviously, I can be the only person in the entire
universe for whom those things work, nevertheless maybe they will (or already are) work for you!

### Tip #1 - replace your mouse with a trackball!
I have used a mouse for decades. Of course, from time to time I changed them as the technology evolved. A ball-based to an optical, then to laser and wireless. The comfort of usage was higher over time
as those pointers got better and better built and functions, nevertheless the general idea of the hand movement remained exactly the same. As I spent pretty long hours in from of my laptop,
I was always feeling this unpleasant tension in my hand after using mouse after the whole day. I have never developed any bigger issue, still I decided it is a high time to do something about it.
I have read about different possibilities, like using a vertical mouse, a trackball or trying to just skip using a mouse at all. Despite I am a big fun of a keyboard usage and key shortucts,
switching between many browser tabs and open windows is a job for a mouse, at least from my opinion. As I love geeky things, I decided to go for a trackball. After few days of working with a trackball,
I understood that it was a big mistake to ignore that device for such a long period - and not even because I got rid of the pain of my hand!

### What trackball to choose?
There are trackballs that can be operated by a thumb or pointing/middle fingers. They have both their pros and cons but eventually I decided just to use a thumb trackball.
Without much thinking, I bought a Logitech M750 - a pretty old model but already battle-tested. This was a good choice as I fell in love with that trackball immediately.
One sad thing about those trackballs is that they are more expensive than regular mice, but this is understandable considering economic laws (i.e. scale of production, popularity etc.)
