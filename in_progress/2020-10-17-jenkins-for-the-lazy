I guess nobody likes creating Jenkins jobs. And probably their maintenance is even worse, if done manually. There are bunch of tools that come to the rescuse
and here I will describe them in a nutshell.

### Little bit of history

### Job DSL in a nutshell
- loops
- creating jobs for pipelines
- creating jobs for multibranch pipelines

### Jenkins pipelines approach
- declarative approach
- when clause
- agents and lightweight threads
- cron trigger etc.
- parameters
- sending emails, jacoco etc.

### Combining them together for a really lazy developer:)

### Creating views
