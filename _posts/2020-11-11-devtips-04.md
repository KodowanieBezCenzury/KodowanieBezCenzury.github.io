We all know there are lots of people unhappy with their work. It is not that easy to find something that meets all Ikigai criteria. I heavy believe that doing something
meaningful, fulfilling yet economically rewarding is achievable for lots of people, maybe even most of them. One of the best thing when starting searching for a "dream" job or occupation
is to understand who we really are and what our souls want to achieve. It is so common we fall under well-established thinking what a good job or a career is or what
can give us a happiness. Diving deeper into our mind can shed more light on the career path and our whole life as well. Even if we already have found something we love doing, this knowledge
can increase our productivity and release us from lots of psychical tensions or stressors.
