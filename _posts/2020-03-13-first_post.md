This post is going to be pretty short, even though it took me more than 10 years of commercial experience and days of thinking to finally write that. Generally speaking, I am going to create yet another programming blog. Even if that may sound boring, hundreds or thousands of another blogs, written by people with passion, were and are still giving me incredible amount of fun and different outlook to the IT industry. Not to mention they saved my a** may times, just like stack overflow. So, why to not participate in that?

As I mentioned, it took me so much (>10 yrs) to write a first post. I think there were various of reasons:
- I always felt too inexperienced, incapable to write someting meaningfull. Now I see that I will always be more or less inexperienced and also do not care so much about what other think about me.
- Perfectionism kills
- Impostor syndrome is another obvious reason. Understanding dynamics behind that is really revealing
- I still dislike all social medias and blogging is somehow similar.

Yet, I see I lose too much to stay quiet:
- I cannot document my work, thoughts, progress. During those 10 years, I heavily analyzed different tools, frameworks, solutions... And lost all interesting findings just because I have not written down that
- I cannot share anything with anyone. And maybe someone, somewhere, sometime will find something here useful.


I will be very surprised if anyone just reaches to this point. If yes, thank you very much! I hope  I will be able to produce at least something useful here.

And one another thing I almost forgot... Welcome in my mini blog! :)
